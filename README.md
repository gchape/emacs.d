# emacs.d

This repository contains (init.el and packages.el) my personal Emacs configuration.

## Features

- **Minimal GUI**: The UI elements such as toolbars, scrollbars, and menus are disabled for a cleaner interface.
- **Time Display**: The time is displayed in the mode line in a `HH:MM` format.
- **Package Management**: Uses `use-package` for managing packages and configurations.
- **Themes**: Gruvbox light theme for a comfortable UI.
- **File Tree Navigation**: Neotree with icons and custom keybindings for easy navigation.
- **Completion**: Vertico for an enhanced completion experience.
- **Icons**: All-the-icons package for file icons.
- **Mood-Line**: A modern mode line with Fira Code glyphs for a clean look.

## Requirements

- Emacs 27 or higher (though it may work with older versions).
- `use-package` is required to handle package installations and configurations.
